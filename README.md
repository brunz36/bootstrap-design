Welcome to TIY Sports, the top sport tracking website for The Iron Yard student, staff, and alumni. We will be building the most elaborate system for tracking the various teams and sports we love to play here at TIY.

However, before we can get started implementing our features we need to validate our visual design.

Our illustrious designer, B. Strap, has provided us with the following mockups for what the site should look like in both mobile and desktop forms. We also have the original image assets used in the mockup.

Our task is to reproduce this design!
